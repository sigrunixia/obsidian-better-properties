## Installation

> [!CAUTION]
>
> **DISCLAIMER**
>
> This plugin makes heavy use of the _undocumented Obsidian API_ and uses a few _monkey-patches_ around existing app functions.
>
> Because of the above, this plugin is prone to unforeseen, breaking changes on new updates to the Obsidian application.
>
> If you use this plugin, I would recommend you _turn off_ automatic updates for Obsidian _or_ be prepared to open bug reports and/or wait for fixes

## Contributing

- Bugs, feature requests, questions-- [Open an issue!](https://github.com/unxok/obsidian-better-properties/issues/new/choose)
- Pull requests-- likely won't be accepted at this time as the plugin is still in very early stages
- Translations-- _instructions TBD_

## Docs

My goal is to not _need_ to create official documentation for the features of this plugin. If needed, I may add additional help text to different settings or modals as needed. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/unxok/obsidian-better-properties/issues/new/choose) if you notice something that needs better documentation, whether within obsidian or not.

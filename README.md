> [!WARNING] > **DISCLAIMER**
>
> This plugin aims to extend and seamlessly integrate into the existing metadata properties core-feature.
>
> In order to be so closely integrated with core features, this plugin makes _heavy_ use of the _undocumented Obsidian API_ and uses a few _monkey-patches_ around existing app functions.
>
> Because of the above, this plugin is prone to unforeseen, breaking changes on new updates to the Obsidian application.
>
> If you use this plugin, I would recommend you _turn off automatic updates_ for Obsidian _or_ be prepared to open bug reports and/or wait for fixes when Obsidian updates release.

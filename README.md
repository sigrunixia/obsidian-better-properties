## Docs

My goal is to not _need_ to create official documentation for the features of this plugin. If needed, I may add additional help text to different settings or modals as needed. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/unxok/obsidian-better-properties/issues/new/choose) if you notice something that needs better documentation, whether within obsidian or not.

## Features

### Additional property types

**note:** Types that have a reserved keyword are marked with an asterisk (\*)

- [ ] Background `NOT COMMITTED`
  - Does it make sense to have this feature when they are plenty of other plugins dedicated to it?
- [ ] Banner `NOT COMMITTED`
  - Does it make sense to have this feature when they are plenty of other plugins dedicated to it?
- [ ] Button `NOT COMMITTED`
  - Running commands isn't that useful, so these would mostly be used for running user-provided js code... but then what's the utility of this type when there's the "Custom" type?
- [ ] Calculation
- [x] Color
- [ ] Custom
- [ ] Created\* `NOT COMMITTED`
  - My current draft of this renders it un-editable and the user can set a custom format. Is this even that useful? Would it be useful if you could edit it and it actually updates the file metadata?
- [x] Date Custom
  - [Properties: let the user customize the way Dates/Times are displayed (independently from OS)](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/properties-let-the-user-customize-the-way-dates-times-are-displayed-independently-from-os/64139/108)
  - [Date & time property type doesn‚Äôt display or edit seconds](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/date-time-property-type-doesnt-display-or-edit-seconds/104154/3)
- [ ] Date Range `NOT COMMITTED`
  - You can achieve this with a "group" type and sub-properties name like "from" and "to", so I'm unsure if there's a strong need for this.
- [x] Select
- [x] Group
- [ ] Image `NOT COMMITTED`
  - [New property type: media](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/new-property-type-media/99259/1)
  - Is this necessary since you can do an embed with the "Markdown"
- [x] Markdown
  - [Properties & Bases: Parse (Render) Markdown in text properties // Allow mixing text and links in string fields](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/properties-bases-parse-render-markdown-in-text-properties-allow-mixing-text-and-links-in-string-fields/66542/18)
- [ ] Modified\* `NOT COMMITTED`
  - Unsure if useful enough. Same note as "Created" type above
- [ ] Multiselect `NOT COMMITTED`
  - You can achieve this with a "list" type and custom suggestions, so is there enough of a need to have a dedicated "multiselect" type as well?
- [ ] Progress
- [ ] Relation
  - [Add support for automatic, bidirectional and separately named list properties](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/add-support-for-automatic-bidirectional-and-separately-named-list-properties/76175/4)
- [x] Select
- [x] Slider
- [x] Rating
- [ ] Tags Category
  - [Add a property type for tags / multiple tag-based properties](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/add-a-property-type-for-tags-multiple-tag-based-properties/63810/15)
  - [Properties: Recognize tags in text property when formatted as ‚Äú#tags‚Äù](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/properties-recognize-tags-in-text-property-when-formatted-as-tags/63812/40)
- [x] Time
- [ ] Title\* `NOT COMMITTED`
  - Mimics what the plugin [Frontmatter Title](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-front-matter-title-plugin) does, so is it worth it to include these features in this plugin?
- [x] Toggle

### Metadata (frontmatter) Editor

- [x] Resizable, draggable property label width
- [x] Hidden properties
  - [Toggle visibility of/hide specific properties](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/toggle-visibility-of-hide-specific-properties/64948)

  - [x] Toggle showing hidden properties
  - [x] Sort properties
  - [ ] Synchronize with template

# Better Properties

What if Properties in Obsidian were... better?

This plugin adds many different properties-related features, such as new property types and per-property settings.

> [!WARNING] > **DISCLAIMER**
>
> This plugin aims to extend and seamlessly integrate into the existing metadata properties core-feature.
>
> In order to be so closely integrated with core features, this plugin makes _heavy_ use of the _undocumented Obsidian API_ and uses a few _monkey-patches_ around existing app functions.
>
> Because of the above, this plugin is prone to unforeseen, breaking changes on new updates to the Obsidian application.
>
> If you use this plugin, I would recommend you _turn off_ automatic updates for Obsidian _or_ be prepared to open bug reports and/or wait for fixes

## Where's the docs??

My goal is to not _need_ to create official documentation for the features of this plugin. If needed, I may add additional help text to different settings or modals as needed. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/unxok/obsidian-better-properties/issues/new/choose) if you notice something that needs better documentation, whether within obsidian or not.
